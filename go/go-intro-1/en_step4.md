## Exercise 3
# Challenge Variables
Write a code that prints your name, surname, age, and whether you are a student or not to the screen.
name           -> string
surname        -> string
age            -> integer
student or not -> boolean

Example Code:

package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
age := 25
name := "Alice"

python
Copy code
fmt.Println("Name:", name)
fmt.Println("Age:", age)
}

Let's create a new page.

go
Copy code
vim variables2.go
Write the code (use "i" for insert mode) and save and exit ( Esc + wq )
Run it
```
go run variables2.go
```
If the output is correct, you did it. Defining variables in Golang is this easy :)
