### Step 2 : Slices
Slices are a fundamental concept in Go and provide a more powerful and flexible alternative to arrays. Slices are dynamic in nature and can grow or shrink as needed. They are built on top of arrays and provide a convenient way to work with a portion of an array.

Creating Slices
Slices can be created in a number of ways. The most common way is to use the make function. The make function creates a new slice with a specified length and capacity.

Here's an example:

go
Copy code
// Create a slice with length 3 and capacity 5
s := make([]int, 3, 5)
fmt.Println(s) // Output: [0 0 0]
In the example above, we create a slice s with length 3 and capacity 5. The make function initializes the elements of the slice with their zero value, which is 0 for integer types.

We can also create a slice using a slice literal. A slice literal is a shorthand notation for initializing a slice.

Here's an example:

go
Copy code
// Create a slice using a slice literal
s := []int{1, 2, 3}
fmt.Println(s) // Output: [1 2 3]
In the example above, we create a slice s with three elements using a slice literal.

Modifying Slices
Slices can be modified by assigning new values to their elements or by using slice operations such as append and copy.

Here's an example of assigning a new value to a slice element:

go
Copy code
// Assign a new value to a slice element
s := []int{1, 2, 3}
s[0] = 4
fmt.Println(s) // Output: [4 2 3]
In the example above, we assign the value 4 to the first element of the slice s.

The append function is used to add one or more elements to the end of a slice. If the underlying array of the slice has enough capacity, the append function simply adds the new elements to the end of the slice. If not, a new array is allocated and the existing elements of the slice are copied to the new array.

Here's an example of using the append function:

go
Copy code
// Append elements to a slice
s := []int{1, 2, 3}
s = append(s, 4, 5)
fmt.Println(s) // Output: [1 2 3 4 5]
In the example above, we use the append function to add the elements 4 and 5 to the end of the slice s.

The copy function is used to copy elements from one slice to another. The copy function returns the number of elements copied.

Here's an example of using the copy function:

go
Copy code
// Copy elements from one slice to another
s1 := []int{1, 2, 3}
s2 := make([]int, len(s1))
copy(s2, s1)
fmt.Println(s2) // Output: [1 2 3]
In the example above, we use the copy function to copy the elements of the slice s1 to the slice s2.
