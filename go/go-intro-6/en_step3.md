### Step 3: Manual Memory Management in Go

Although Go's garbage collector is highly effective, it's still possible to manually allocate and deallocate memory using the make() and delete() functions. However, this is generally discouraged as it can lead to more complex and error-prone code.

Here's an example of how you can use the make() function to allocate memory for a slice:

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    slice := make([]int, 5, 10)
    slice[0] = 1
    slice[1] = 2
    slice[2] = 3
    slice[3] = 4
    slice[4] = 5
    fmt.Println(slice)
    // Deallocate the memory for the slice
    slice = nil
}
```
In this program, we use the make() function to allocate memory for a slice of integers with a length of 5 and a capacity of 10. We then assign values to the slice's elements and print the entire slice to the console. Finally, we deallocate the memory for the slice by setting it to nil.
