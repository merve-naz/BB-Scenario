## Step 5: Debugging tools in Go

In addition to debuggers, Go provides several built-in tools for debugging and profiling code, such as go test, which can be used to run tests and generate coverage reports, and go pprof, which can be used to profile CPU and memory usage.

To see an example of how to use the go test command for debugging in Go, create a new file called main_test.go with the following code:

```main_test.go```

```
package main

import (
	"testing"
)

func TestMyFunc(t *testing.T) {
	result := 40 
	if result != 45 {
		t.Errorf("myFunc() returned %d, expected %d", result, 45)
	}
}
``` 
This code defines a test function called TestMyFunc that calls the myFunc function and checks that it returns the expected result. To run the test, open a terminal and run the following command:

```go test```

You should see the following output:
PASS \
ok      file    0.001s

This indicates that the test passed successfully. 

If the test will be failed, it would have printed an error message indicating what went wrong.
change result:=44 like that, you should see

--- FAIL: TestMyFunc (0.00s) \
    main_test.go:10: result is 44, expected 45 \
FAIL \
exit status 1 \
FAIL    file    0.003s
