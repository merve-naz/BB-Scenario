## Step 6: Debugging best practices in Go

When debugging Go code, it's important to follow best practices such as starting with simple tests and adding complexity incrementally, using version control to keep track of changes, and logging errors and debug information to aid in troubleshooting.

To see an example of how to use logging for debugging in Go, modify the myFunc function from the previous section to log the value of i:

```
package main
import "log"
func main() {
	myFunc()
}
func myFunc() {
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        log.Printf("i = %d\n", i)
    }
}
```
2009/11/10 23:00:00 i = 0 \
2009/11/10 23:00:00 i = 1 \
2009/11/10 23:00:00 i = 2 \
2009/11/10 23:00:00 i = 3 \
2009/11/10 23:00:00 i = 4 \
2009/11/10 23:00:00 i = 5 \
2009/11/10 23:00:00 i = 6 \
2009/11/10 23:00:00 i = 7 \
2009/11/10 23:00:00 i = 8 \
2009/11/10 23:00:00 i = 9 

This code uses the log.Printf function to log the value of i to the console. When the function is run, it will output a log message for each iteration of the loop, making it easier to track the program's progress.

### Conclusion

In this section, we've covered some of the key debugging techniques and best practices in Go, including using print statements and debuggers, using built-in tools like go test and go pprof, and logging errors and debug information.
