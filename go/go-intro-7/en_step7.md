### Step 7: Deploy the microservice to a container orchestration platform
In order to make our microservice highly available and scalable, we can deploy it to a container orchestration platform such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm. In this step, we will deploy our microservice to a Kubernetes cluster.

First, ensure that you have a Kubernetes cluster up and running. You can use a cloud provider such as Google Cloud Platform or Amazon Web Services to create a Kubernetes cluster.

Next, create a Kubernetes deployment for our microservice by creating a deployment YAML file. Here is an example YAML file:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-go
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-go
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-go
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-go
        image: <your-docker-registry>/hello-go:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```
This YAML file creates a deployment with 3 replicas of our microservice, and specifies that our microservice container listens on port 8080.

Apply the deployment YAML file to the Kubernetes cluster using the following command:
```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
This command will create the deployment on the Kubernetes cluster.

Expose the deployment as a Kubernetes service using the following command:
```
kubectl expose deployment hello-go --type=LoadBalancer --port=80 --target-port=8080
```
This command exposes the deployment as a load-balanced service on port 80.

Obtain the external IP address of the load-balancer using the following command:
```
kubectl get services
```
This command will output the external IP address of the load-balancer. You can use this IP address to access the microservice from outside the Kubernetes cluster.

Test the microservice by sending HTTP requests to the external IP address of the load-balancer. You should receive responses from the microservice.
By following these steps, you have deployed your microservice to a container orchestration platform and made it highly available and scalable.
