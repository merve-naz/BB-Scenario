### Step 2: Set up a basic Go microservice
Now that we have an understanding of microservices, let's create a basic Go microservice. In this step, we will set up a new Go project, create an HTTP server, and write a simple endpoint.

Create a new directory for your project by running the following command:

```mkdir go-microservice && cd go-microservice```
Initialize a new Go module by running the following command:

```
go mod init github.com/{your-username}/go-microservice
```
This will create a new go.mod file that will keep track of your project's dependencies.

Create a new file called main.go and open it in your preferred text editor.

Import the necessary packages by adding the following lines of code to the top of your main.go file:

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
)
```
The fmt package is used for printing output, the log package is used for logging, and the net/http package is used for creating an HTTP server.

Add a handler function that will serve as the endpoint for our microservice. The following code sets up a simple handler that will return a "Hello, World!" message:

```
func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
}
```
Create the main function and start the HTTP server by adding the following code to your main.go file:

```
func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```
This code tells the HTTP server to use the handler function as the endpoint for requests to the root path (/). It also tells the server to listen on port 8080.

Now you have a basic Go microservice that responds with a "Hello, World!" message. You can run your microservice by running the following command:

```
go run main.go
```
You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed in your terminal. You can test your microservice by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080.
