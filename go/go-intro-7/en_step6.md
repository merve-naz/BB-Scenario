### Step 6: Implement API Gateway
In a microservices architecture, API Gateway acts as a reverse proxy to handle all the requests and responses to the microservices. It provides a single entry point for the client to communicate with the backend microservices. In this step, we will implement an API Gateway for our microservices using Go.

Create a new directory named api-gateway in your project directory.

```
mkdir api-gateway
```
Change directory to the api-gateway directory.

```
cd api-gateway
```
Create a new Go module for the API Gateway.

```
go mod init api-gateway
```
Install the required packages for the API Gateway.

```
go get github.com/gorilla/mux
go get github.com/rs/cors
```
The gorilla/mux package is a popular HTTP router and dispatcher for Go, and the rs/cors package is a simple CORS middleware for Go.

Create a new file named main.go in the api-gateway directory and add the following code to it:
```
package main

import (
    "github.com/gorilla/mux"
    "github.com/rs/cors"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new router
    r := mux.NewRouter()

    // Define the endpoints
    r.HandleFunc("/users", getUsers).Methods("GET")
    r.HandleFunc("/users/{id}", getUser).Methods("GET")
    r.HandleFunc("/users", createUser).Methods("POST")
    r.HandleFunc("/users/{id}", updateUser).Methods("PUT")
    r.HandleFunc("/users/{id}", deleteUser).Methods("DELETE")

    // Set up the CORS middleware
    c := cors.New(cors.Options{
        AllowedOrigins: []string{"*"},
        AllowedMethods: []string{"GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"},
    })
    handler := c.Handler(r)

    // Start the server
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", handler)
}

func getUsers(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Call the user service to get the list of users
}

func getUser(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Call the user service to get a specific user
}

func createUser(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Call the user service to create a new user
}

func updateUser(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Call the user service to update a specific user
}

func deleteUser(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Call the user service to delete a specific user
}
```
In this code, we define the endpoints for our API Gateway using the gorilla/mux package. We also define the functions that will be called to handle each endpoint. Finally, we set up the CORS middleware using the rs/cors package to allow cross-origin requests from any domain.

Run the API Gateway using the following command:

```
go run main.go
```
This will start the API Gateway on port 8080.

With these steps, you have implemented an API Gateway for your microservices using Go. The API Gateway provides a unified entry point for the client to communicate with the backend microservices. In the next step, we will deploy our microservices and API Gateway to a cloud platform.
