## Step 2: Create a simple Go web application

In this step, you will create a simple Go web application that can be deployed to a cloud platform. Here's how to do it:

1. Create a new directory for your Go project and navigate to it:
```$ mkdir my-web-app && cd my-web-app```
2. Create a new file called main.go with the following content:
```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprint(w, "Hello, World!")
    })

    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

This creates a simple web server that listens for incoming HTTP requests and responds with the message "Hello, World!".

3. Test the web application locally by running the following command:
```$ go run main.go```

This will start the web server on port 8080.

4. Open a web browser and go to the URL http://localhost:8080. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed in your browser.

5. Once you have verified that the web application works locally, you can deploy it to a cloud platform. One popular option is to use the Heroku cloud platform. To deploy your application to Heroku, you will first need to install the Heroku CLI by running the following command:

```$ apk add --no-cache heroku```
apk update && apk add apk-tools

6. Next, create a new Heroku application by running the following command:
```$ heroku create```
----problem here ---------------------------
This will create a new Heroku application with a randomly generated name.

Congratulations! You have now created a simple Go web application and deployed it to the Heroku cloud platform.
