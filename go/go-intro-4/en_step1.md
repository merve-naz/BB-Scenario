## Step 1: Install Go and the Go compiler

To build and deploy Go applications, you first need to install Go and the Go compiler on your system. Here's how to do it on an Alpine Linux system:

Open your virtual terminal and type the following command to install Go:
```$ apk add go```
Check that Go has been installed correctly by running the following command:
```$ go version```

This should display the version of Go installed on your system.

Next, install the Go compiler by running the following command:
```$ apk add build-base```
This will install the build tools needed to compile Go code.

4.To verify that the Go compiler has been installed correctly, create a new file called hello.go with the following content:
```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
5.Compile the hello.go file using the following command:
```$ go build hello.go```
This will create an executable file called hello.

6.Finally, run the hello executable to verify that it works:
```$ ./hello```
This should display the message "Hello, World!".

Congratulations! You have now installed Go and the Go compiler on your system and compiled and run your first Go application.
